What is microwave?
------------------

Microwave (often shortened as Î¼wave) is a lightweight Google Wave
client built using the Google Wave Data API. Originally it was made
using reverse engineered JSON client/server code descended from the
Wave Reader project.


Features
--------

Microwave is pretty complete. Or at least it's as complete as the data API
really allows, with the exception of rich text (which is arguably a really big
thing).
